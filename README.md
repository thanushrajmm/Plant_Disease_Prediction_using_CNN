**Plant Disease Prediction System Using Deep Learning**
Description
The Plant Disease Prediction System is a deep learning-based application designed to identify plant diseases by analyzing images of plant leaves. This system aims to help farmers, agricultural specialists, and gardeners quickly diagnose plant diseases, enabling timely treatment and reducing crop loss.

By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a large dataset of plant images, the system accurately detects various diseases across different plant species. With a simple interface, users can upload images and receive real-time disease predictions.

Key Features
Image Input for Disease Detection: Users can upload images of plant leaves to the system for analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Image data is resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model robustness and accuracy.
CNN Model for Image Classification: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the PlantVillage dataset to classify different plant diseases based on leaf images.
Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on thousands of labeled images and evaluated to ensure high accuracy on both training and validation data.
Disease Prediction: Based on the trained model, the system predicts the most probable disease from the input image, providing a clear and interpretable output.
User-Friendly Interface: The system is accessible through a straightforward interface that allows users to upload images and view predictions easily.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and application deployment.
TensorFlow & Keras: Deep learning libraries used to design, train, and test the CNN model.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array handling, essential for data manipulation.
Pandas: Data analysis library used for managing dataset metadata.

Project Workflow
Data Collection: The PlantVillage dataset is downloaded using the Kaggle API, which contains thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
Data Preprocessing: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels, normalized, and augmented with rotations, flips, and zooms to improve model generalization.
Model Architecture: The CNN model is built with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers to detect patterns in leaf images and classify diseases.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on labeled images with a validation set to monitor performance. categorical_crossentropy is used as the loss function, and accuracy is the evaluation metric.
Prediction and Inference: Users upload images, which are preprocessed and fed to the trained model. The modelâ€™s output is mapped to disease labels for user-friendly results.

Future Enhancements
Real-time Field Application: Deploying the model to mobile platforms for offline, on-field disease detection.
Integration with Weather and Soil Data: Incorporating environmental factors to improve disease prediction accuracy.
Feedback Mechanism: Adding a feedback system to enhance model accuracy by retraining with new, user-submitted data.
